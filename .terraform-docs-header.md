# Azure DevOps Agent Container Module

This Terraform module provides a framework for deploying self-hosted Azure DevOps agents using Azure Container Instances. It simplifies the deployment of containerized build agents, ensuring they are secure, scalable, and integrated with Azure Container Registry.

## Purpose

The module's main objective is to streamline the provisioning of containerized Azure DevOps agents, making it easy to deploy and manage custom build agents that run in Azure Container Instances. This enables teams to run their CI/CD pipelines in a controlled, isolated environment with specific tooling requirements.

## Key Capabilities

- **Azure Container Registry Integration**  
  Automatically creates or uses an existing Azure Container Registry, builds container images, and manages access credentials.

- **Configurable Container Groups**  
  Deploy multiple container groups with different configurations, supporting various build environments (.NET, Java, etc.).

- **Private Network Integration**  
  Deploy agents into existing virtual networks for enhanced security and access to private resources.

- **Monitoring and Logging**  
  Integration with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for comprehensive container insights and troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details

The module implements a secure approach to container deployment. Each container group runs in a private subnet and uses managed identities for accessing Azure Container Registry. Container images are built and stored in ACR, ensuring consistent and reliable agent deployments.

### Architecture Overview

The module deploys container groups into your virtual network, allowing them to access both internal resources and Azure DevOps services. Each container group can host multiple containers, enabling you to run different types of build agents based on your needs.

### Best Practices

When deploying agents, consider:
- Using separate container groups for different build requirements
- Implementing proper network segmentation
- Managing secrets through secure environment variables
- Monitoring agent performance and scaling as needed
- Regular updates of base images and tooling

## Diagnostic Settings

Container insights are routed to Log Analytics, providing visibility into:
- Container health and performance
- Agent connection status
- Build job execution
- Network connectivity issues

## Known Limitations

- Container groups must be deployed into subnets with the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups delegation
- Azure Container Registry Basic SKU is used by default
- Windows containers require specific subnet configurations
- Container groups are limited to the resources specified during creation

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "ado_agents" {
  source = "github.com/example/terraform-azurerm-azure-devops-agent"

  resource_group_name      = "rg-ado-agents"
  location                = "eastus"
  container_registry_name = "acrdevops"
  
  container_groups = {
    "dotnet" = {
      name                = "dotnet-agents"
      resource_group_name = "rg-ado-agents"
      location           = "eastus"
      subnet_id          = "/subscriptions/.../subnets/agents"
      containers = [
        {
          name            = "dotnet-agent"
          image           = "dotnet-agent"
          tag             = "latest"
          dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile.dotnet"
          cpu             = 2
          memory          = 4
          ports          = []
          environment_variables = {
            AZP_POOL = "Default"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }

  log_analytics_workspace_id  = "/subscriptions/.../workspaces/law"
  log_analytics_workspace_key = "workspace-key"
}
```
